# Spam_detection_model
# Project Overview:
This project builds a Spam SMS Detector using Machine Learning to classify messages as Spam or Ham (Not Spam). It uses Multinomial Naïve Bayes (MultinomialNB), which is well-suited for text classification tasks.
# Tech Stack:
Python
scikit-learn
TF-IDF Vectorization
Naïve Bayes (MultinomialNB)
SHAP for Explainability
# Implementation Steps:
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing: Clean the text (lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword filtering).
2️⃣ Feature Extraction: Convert text to numerical form using TF-IDF vectorization.
3️⃣ Model Training: Train Multinomial Naïve Bayes on SMS data.
4️⃣ Prediction & Evaluation: Measure accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5️⃣ Explainability: Use SHAP to interpret model decisions.
